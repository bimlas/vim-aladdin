To try out, install in your prefered way, then add these lines to your
_.vimrc_:

[source,viml]
----
let g:high_lighters = {
\ '_': {                                                                  <1>
\   'blacklist': ['help', 'qf', 'lf', 'vim-plug'],                        <2>
\ },
\ 'inactive_window': {},                                                  <3>
\ 'indent': {},
\ 'long_line': {'hlgroup': 'DiffAdd'},                                    <4>
\ 'unite_directory': {},
\ 'your_custom_lighter': {'pattern': 'TODO\|NOTE', 'hlgroup': 'ErrorMsg'} <5>
\ }

<1> The `_` key means these settings will affect every lighter,
<2> for example all of them will be disabled in these filetypes.
<3> You can add predefined lighters, whose can be found in
    _autoload/high/light_ directory.
<4> To override the global settings, pass the lighter-specific ones in the
    dictionary.
<5> You can create your own lighters like you want.

By default every lighter in `g:high_lighters` are enabled at Vim startup, but
passing `'enabled': 0` will disable it. To use the lighter, call `:HighEnable
lighter` or `:HighToggle lighter`.

The available configuration parameters can be found in link:plugin/high.vim[]
as `g:high.defaults`.

Any of the settings can be overriden when adding a custom lighter, but some of
them has hardcoded values in built-in highlighters. For example `pattern` in
link:autoload/high/light/inactive_window.vim[inactive_window] have to be `.*`
to match everything in the inactive window, so it cannot be customized. The
settings below the call of `high#core#Customize()` are not customizables.

Some lighters have specifical settings, like
link:autoload/high/light/indent.vim[indent]: `_levels`, `_hlgroupA`, etc. It
can be configured as above.
