= High: all-in-one highlighter plugin for Vim

A Vim plugin to highlight custom patterns on any buffer (filetype
whitelist/blacklist supported), for example highlight indentation, inactive
window, word under the cursor or even anything what you want.

[NOTE]
====
It's in beta version (API and defaults may change) while I don't get enough
response that everything works as expected.

To try out, install in your prefered way, then enable a lighter by
`:HighEnable <C-D>`.

To enable lighters by default, add the prefered ones to `g:high_lighter` as a
dictionary in your _.vimrc_, like this:

[source,viml]
----
let g:high_lighters = {
\ '_': {                                                                  <1>
\   'blacklist': ['help', 'qf', 'lf', 'vim-plug'],                        <2>
\ },
\ 'inactive_window': {},                                                  <3>
\ 'indent': {},
\ 'long_line': {'hlgroup': 'DiffAdd'},                                    <4>
\ 'unite_directory': {},
\ 'your_custom_lighter': {'pattern': 'TODO\|NOTE', 'hlgroup': 'ErrorMsg'} <5>
\ }
----
<1> The `_` key means these settings will affect every lighter,
<2> for example all of them will be disabled in these filetypes.
<3> You can add predefined lighters, whose can be found in
    link:autoload/high/light/[] directory.
<4> To override the global settings, pass the lighter-specific ones in the
    dictionary.
<5> You can create your own lighters as you want.

== Override default settings

By default every lighter in `g:high_lighters` are enabled at Vim startup, but
passing `'enabled': 0` will disable it. To use the lighter, call `:HighEnable
lighter` or `:HighToggle lighter`.

The available configuration parameters can be found in link:plugin/high.vim[]
as `g:high.defaults`. Options starting with double underscore
(`__init_function` for example) are private and you shouldn't override those.
See `:help matchadd` for `group`, `pattern` and `priority`; `:highlight` for
possible values of `hlgroup`.

Some lighters have specifical settings, starting with an underscore (`_length`
of link:autoload/high/light/long_line.vim[long_line] for example) are
lighter-specific, the underscore is used only to prevent conflicts with global
settings, but you can safely override those.

== Example of user-defined highlight

For example, a very basic implentation of
https://github.com/Valloric/vim-operator-highlight should looks like this:

[source,viml]
----
let g:high_lighters = {
\ 'operator': {                                                            <1>
\   'pattern': '[-?+|*;:,<>&|!~%=)({}.\[\]]',                              <2>
\   'blacklist': ['help', 'markdown', 'qf', 'conque_term', 'diff', 'html', <3>
\                 'css', 'less', 'xml', 'sh', 'bash', 'notes', 'jinja'],
\   'hlgroup': 'Error',                                                    <4>
\ }}
----
<1> Add a name to the lighter (which is not in use),
<2> define the pattern to match,
<3> add whitelist/blacklist,
<4> choose a hlgroup from the existing ones.
